# Geo-Attendance-System

Geo-Attendance-System is a location-based attendance tracking system. It allows teachers to set attendance locations, and students can mark attendance only when they are physically present within the defined geofence area.

This project includes two separate dashboards:
- **Teacher Dashboard:** For adding students, setting attendance radius, viewing slots and students, and downloading attendance.
- **Student Dashboard:** For logging in, checking allowed status based on location, and marking attendance.
